title: About the Neighborhood
intro: The neighborhood is comprised of 52 homes.
---

Nine homes are adjacent to the other 43, which are directly to its east. Ingress and egress through both is the same.

Both neighborhoods are next to a city-owned greenbelt to their north and east.

The bigger neighborhood has many distinctive features, including underground utilities, paved gutters, lantern lights in front of most homes, a sign and entry way at its western entrance, and laurel hedges along its southern and western sides.
