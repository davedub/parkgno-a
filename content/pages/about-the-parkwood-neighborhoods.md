Parkwood Estates has many distinctive features, including underground utilities, paved gutters, lantern lights in front of most homes, a sign and entry way at its western entrance, and laurel hedges along its southern and western sides.

Parkwood Club, Inc. serves as the homeowners' association for both neighborhoods. It maintains common areas and monitors compliance with the protective covenants that apply to Parkwood Estates.
